# Airline AI Assistant ‚úàÔ∏èü§ñ

This project is an AI-powered assistant built using Meta‚Äôs LLaMA 3 model to help airlines predict delays, analyze flight data, and improve operational efficiency. It combines natural language interaction with traditional ML and visualizations inside a single Jupyter notebook.

## Features
- Flight delay prediction
- Natural language queries via LLaMA3 (or optionally OpenAI's GPT)
- Visual insights from historical flight data

## Technologies
- LLaMA 3
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook and run all cells
